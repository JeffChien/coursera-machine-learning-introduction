# Trouble shooting

## TensorFlow problem with Apple silicon

GPU support is not good, I've encountered performance issue and missing API. 2 ways to run with CPU.

```python
with tf.device("/cpu:0"):
    model.compile()
    model.fit()
```

or use cpu only [ðŸ”—](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/58845/how-to-disable-gpu-with-tensorflow)

### extremely slow with GPU

Increasing the batch size helps, but the problem is that CPU is still much faster in the same condition, really have no idea what's wrong in the `tensorflow-metal` package.
